## Abstract
In this post, we explore how **probabilistic methods and AI-driven anomaly detection** can enhance traditional data quality frameworks, making them more responsive, scalable, and effective in real-world healthcare environments. We will briefly cover why organizations should care, what makes a robust data quality program, and examine a few AI-enabled probabilistic models suitable for data quality programs.

[TODO: List assessment criteria]

## Background

### Why Data Quality Matters More Than Ever
Data quality improvement programs have existed for ages but have mostly lacked the necessary incentive models for any meaningful impact. Data which was perfectly fine for clinical use by a human is not suitable for advanced digital processing. The growing use of healthcare data for interoperability, decision support, and quality measurement has raised both the standards for data quality and the burden of meeting them. Each of these applications are wholly dependent on the quality of the data itself to ensure system accuracy. In addition, more problems are being addressed with Artificial Intelligence (AI) which is well-known to be both data hungry and limited to the accuracy of its training data. As a result, incentives and investments in data quality innovation will continue to grow alongside the exploding applications that need them.

### What is Data Quality?
If we are to improve data quality, we must first unambiguously define what it means (at least in the context of this post). Definitions of data quality are inherently nebulous, context specific, and strongly correlated to their use. Let's try and define this upfront.

> **Data Quality** is any issue present in or absence from the data which negatively impacts a given use case.

Exploring a few, obvious examples might help:
- A BMI recorded as `22.5 kg` instead of the correct `kg/m²`, conflating weight with a ratio.
- An A1c result of `6.4%` incorrectly coded as `Glucose [Mass/volume] in Blood` instead of `Glycated Hemoglobin`, misleading long-term glucose control assessments.
- An encounter date recorded in the future, which can distort care timelines and reporting.
- A telehealth service billed using HCPCS code `G2012` (Virtual check-in by a physician) which CMS stopped reimbursing after 2023.
- Bodysite missing for surgical procedures.
- No hypertension diagnosis for a large, aging population.

Other scenarios are more nuanced and case specific:
- A patient record contains only a zipcode or birth year, limiting the ability to stratify by age or region accurately.
- Prior authorization delays result in gaps between clinical recommendation and actual care delivery, affecting longitudinal data integrity.
- Latency in data synchronization (e.g., between EHR and analytics systems) leads to outdated or incomplete views of patient activity.
- Semantic mismatch or drift as data moves between systems or standards reducing accuracy, eroding trust, and decreasing usefulness.
- Exclusion data (like Frailty or Hospice) not fed to quality measurement system leading to lower clinical performance rates.

This is not an exhaustive list by any means but should suffice for our purposes and resonate with SMEs in the interoperability & quality measurement space. If we unpack these a bit, we'll notice some common theme (known as data quality dimensions in the [Kahn framework](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5051581/)):
- **Conformance**: Mostly correct but coded or formatted incorrectly.
- **Completeness**: Absent because of capture, mapping, or operational issues (indeterminant based on what we know).
- **Plausibility**: Unusual or unlikely given contextual or clinical domain knowledge.

If you're familiar with the [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) principle, it might be useful to think of these as addressing different concerns: is it shaped correctly, do you have all you need, is it believable? It's also debatable whether these three dimensions cover all concerns either directly or as a sub-dimension, such as timeliness or internal/external consistency, but we'll leave the debate for another time.

### Practical Considerations

**Incentive Alignment**: It's important to note that the healthcare data ecosystem is a highly dynamic and volitile environment where information is constantly being captured, exchanged, translated, enriched, and consumed across myriad organizational boundaries. More often than not, the organizations affected by poor data quality are not the ones positioned to fix them hence the critical importance of properly aligned incentive models and feedback loops.

**Proving the Negative**: Data quality validation is fundamentally a form of software testing, but with its focus shifted from logic to data. As Edsger Dijkstra famously said, "Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence." The same principle applies to data quality. We can only confirm that no issues were found in the areas we tested but not that the data is entirely free of problems. This underscores a key truth: the more checks you run, the more confidence you gain, the more resources you consume.

### Sources of Issues and Solution Placement
So try to answer these questions:
- Where did the error occur, who was responsible, and could it have been corrected?

Healthcare data is vast, heterogeneous, and often noisy. Traditional **deterministic rules** (like required fields or code set conformance) are essential—but they only catch **known, predefined issues**.

**Probabilistic methods**, including statistical models and machine learning, allow us to:

- Detect **unexpected anomalies** in patient records or workflows
- Adapt quality checks as data patterns evolve
- Prioritize issues based on likelihood, severity, or risk
- Support early detection of systemic data issues

These methods don't replace traditional frameworks—they **augment them**, making the overall system more intelligent and proactive.

## Integrating AI-Driven Anomaly Detection into Healthcare Systems

To make probabilistic methods practical, they must fit within existing healthcare operations. Here's a high-level framework that supports integration:

### 1. Foundations: Governance and Standards

Before layering in AI, ensure a baseline structure:

- **Data ownership and stewardship** roles are clearly defined
- Standardized **metrics for plausibility, conformance, and completeness**
- Alignment with frameworks like the **Kahn model for data quality**  
- Documentation of data flows and known edge cases

### 2. Rule-Based Layer (Deterministic)

Maintain a set of core deterministic checks, such as:

- Required field validation
- Code value set enforcement
- Referential integrity
- Logic-based rules (e.g., discharge date after admission date)

This forms the **baseline**—useful for detecting known issues efficiently.

### 3. Probabilistic Layer (AI/ML-Based)

Introduce AI and statistical techniques to:

- **Detect unusual patterns** in patient data, lab values, or operational metrics
- Identify **outliers and inconsistencies** that fall outside rule-based checks
- Learn from historical patterns to predict future data issues
- Support **dynamic thresholds** rather than fixed ones

Example techniques include clustering, time-series analysis, and probabilistic inference models.

### 4. Operational Integration

Embed data quality monitoring into broader quality operations:

- Real-time or near-real-time **monitoring dashboards**
- Integration with **incident management or quality improvement workflows**
- Feedback loops between detection and correction teams
- Ongoing **model refinement** using labeled outcomes and expert review

## Making It Work: Culture and Scalability

Even the best algorithms won't succeed without cultural alignment:

- Train teams on the **difference between deterministic errors and probabilistic anomalies**
- Establish **trust in AI-driven alerts** through transparency and validation
- Promote a **culture of data quality ownership**, from clinicians to IT

## Conclusion

Probabilistic methods bring a new level of intelligence to healthcare data quality—but they must be grounded in solid governance, integrated with operational workflows, and designed to work alongside deterministic rules. Together, they create a **hybrid framework** that is not only smarter but also **scalable and resilient** in the face of healthcare's complexity.
